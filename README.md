# code-quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a timed quiz along with a highscore functionality. This project was especially tricky, however I must say it was very fun to work on. The functions include multiple questions that cycle through and a timer which has 60 seconds on it.

The end conditions are either the time running out or you answering all the questions. The more accurate your answers the more points you get per correct answer. There is also a speed component making it so that you need a balance of speed and accuracy to get the highest score possible.

Scores are stored locally and are found in the highscores page located seperately in its own html.

Hope you enjoy!
